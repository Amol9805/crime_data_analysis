# Crime Data Analysis using Python & MySQL

## Project Overview:

This project focuses on end-to-end analysis of crime data using **Python** for data analysis and visualization, and **MySQL** for structured data storage and querying. The objective is to identify crime patterns across geography, time, gender, and crime categories to support data-driven insights that could help law enforcement agencies and policymakers.

The analysis answers key business and analytical questions related to **spatial crime distribution**, **temporal trends**, **gender-based crime involvement**, and **crime-type frequency**.

## Tech Stack:

* Programming Language: Python
* Database: MySQL
* Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
* Environment: Jupyter Notebook

---

## Data Workflow:

1. **Data Ingestion**

   * Crime data loaded into MySQL database
   * Connected MySQL with Python using appropriate connectors

2. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**

   * Handled missing and inconsistent values.
   * Standardized categorical columns (crime type, gender, location).
   * Converted date & time columns for temporal analysis.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

   * Spatial analysis using latitude and longitude.
   * Time-based crime trend analysis.
   * Gender-wise crime distribution.
   * Crime category frequency analysis.

4. **Visualization**

   * Scatter plots for crime hotspots.
   * Bar charts and line plots for trend analysis.
   * Interactive visualizations using Plotly.
   * Actual world map using folium library.

## Key Analysis Performed:

### 1. Spatial Analysis:

* Identified geographical crime hotspots using latitude and longitude.
* Visualized crime occurrence concentration across regions.

### 2. Temporal Analysis:

* Analyzed crime trends over time.
* Identified peak crime periods.

### 3. Gender-based Analysis:

* Compared crime involvement across genders.
* Observed that male involvement was significantly higher than female involvement.

### 4. Crime Type Analysis:

* Identified most frequently occurring crime categories.
* Highlighted crime types that require focused attention.

## Key Insights:

* Certain geographic locations like southern california and downtown consistently show higher crime density (hotspots).
* Crime occurrences are not uniformly distributed over time.
* Male-related crime involvement is significantly higher compared to female.
* A small number of crime categories account for a majority of total cases.

---

## Key Learnings:

* Practical experience in integrating **Python with MySQL** for real-world data analysis.
* Improved understanding of **spatial and temporal crime analytics**.
* Hands-on experience with **data cleaning, EDA, and visualization**.
* Learned to transform raw crime data into actionable insights.

---

## Challenges Faced:

* Handling datasets efficiently between MySQL and Python
* Debugging visualization issues (especially interactive plots)
* Designing meaningful visualizations for spatial data

---

## Conclusion:

This project demonstrates how structured databases combined with Python analytics can be used to uncover meaningful crime patterns. The insights derived from spatial, temporal, and demographic analysis can assist authorities in crime prevention strategies and resource allocation.

The project highlights strong skills in **data analysis, SQL querying, Python visualization, and problem-solving**, making it highly relevant for data analyst and software engineering roles.

## Future Enhancements:

* Predictive modeling to forecast crime hotspots
* Dashboard development using Power BI or Tableau
* Integration with real-time crime data sources.
